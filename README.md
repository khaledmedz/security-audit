## Risk Assessment

**Control Best Practices:** The NIST CSF's first function, "Identify," requires resource dedication to asset identification, classification, and impact assessment on business continuity.

**Risk Score:** On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8 due to a lack of controls and compliance adherence.
